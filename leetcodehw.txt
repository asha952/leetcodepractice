1. 258 add digits
input: an int
function: add individual digits repeatedly of output
output: a single digit

algorithm: split the number by digits
            add them
            check if result is single digit
            if yes, return that
            if not, repeat

2. 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
input: an int
function: reduce number to 0 either by dividing by 2 or subtracting 1
output: number of steps to do so

algorithm: check to see if number is div by 2
            if yes, divide by 2 repeatedly
                keep increasing counter
                if answer is 1, subtract
                    return counter
            if no, subtract by 1,
                check again to first part
